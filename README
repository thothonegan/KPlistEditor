Simple text based plist viewer for KDE. Doesn't do editing yet. At the moment it also doesn't handle binary files, but that should be possible.

Also provides a kpart, mostly so kdevelop can show plists directly.

To build:

cd <project_name_path>
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$KDEDIRS -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..      <- do not forget the ..
make
make install or su -c 'make install'

where $KDEDIRS points to your KDE installation prefix. (usually $HOME/.kde for local)

Requires libplist++-dev, libplist++1, libplist-dev, libplist1 and kdelibs5-dev (ubuntu) or similar packages for other linux systems. For some reason the ubuntu dev package for libplist++-dev doesnt depend on libplist++1.
